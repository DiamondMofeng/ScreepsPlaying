efficiency of carrier:

 -  time cost = 2x distance

 -  capacity = CARRY * 50

for a carrier:

-   efficiency = capacity/time cost

for N carrier:

-  efficiency = capacity * N /time cost 

*  WILL this function has something wrong because of distance? 

      NO, but energy efficiency is affected by N , because of the cost of spawning creep
